MAXYPH is a competitive turn-based moba war simulator game set in the late 1700s but with futuristic weapons and also AI generated realism/surrealism.

Not it isn't!  It's a goddamned puzzle game!

Prototype folder:
- the maxyph_proto_gen.py will generate 100 initial puzzle states that are "valid"
- validity is determined by if the first row can be solved with at least 5 valid words from the word bank.
- the intent is to build a "solver" logic as well, but that is significantly less important.
